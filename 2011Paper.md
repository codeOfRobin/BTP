2 general approaches are used to make 3D textile structures :-
- New machines like 3Tex and Biteam that are specially designed for this purpose.
- Another approach is based on modifying the existing 2D looms so as to make 3D fabric structures  

##  classification of 3D woven structures

#### 3D solid

1st method - Multiple laters of woven structures stitched together.
- Changes in yarn structure, fibre etc can be made. Hybrid of properties will be created through the thickness of the composite.
- Crimps can be introduced in both weft and warp to specific extents to suit property requirements of the fabric.
- Wadding yarns can be added to increase strength
- Vertical stitching can be changed for appropriate through-thckness properties.

2nd method - Orthogonal principle

- All yarns are straight, to take maximum load directly.
- Interlinking depth altered within preform, leading to variable preform thickness

3rd method  - Angle interlock principle
- Weft yarns straight. Warp yarns diagonal.
- More flexible as there are less crossover points.

Based on the mathematical modelling and description of different types of 3D woven architectures, a suite of CAD soft- ware has been created to support the design and manufacture of 3D woven fabrics.

Mathematical models of various 2D and 3D fabrics have been established through the years and the
resulting algorithms are used in the development of CAD/CAM software for the design and manufacture of 2D and 3D fabrics.

3D fabrics with different structural features and the 3D graphical models, if exported in suitable format, can be used to create FE models for the analysis of mechanical, fluid and other properties
